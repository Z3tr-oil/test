As said before the information and cyber security is all about securing the information's and systems from any attack, damage, modification and unauthorized access. but what is a cyber attack and cyber threat.`cyber attack` any attempt to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and steal, modify, or destroy data.`cyber threat` is a potential danger or risk of a vulnerability being exploited causing harm.in nutshell the threat is the possibility of an attack to occur. 
What are the common cyber attacks? first lets categories the attacks and then we will talk about each one of them :
- **malware based**
- **Phishing and Social Engineering**
- **Web and Application-Based Attacks**
- **Network-Based Attacks**
- **Credential and Identity Attacks**
- **Insider Threats**
## malware's 
malware is a short for **Malicious software**, it is a software that is designed to cause harm, steal and/or modify data, and so on. we have many types of malware's we will cover some of them here :
- **viruses**: are the most known type, its a Malicious software that replicates it self and spread on the computer **it self** causing damage to data and software and steal data. It is called 'virus' because of its nature that work like real organic viruses in replication.
- **worms**: a Malicious software that replicates it self and spread on the **network without human interaction**, its usually used to cause harm and/or to carry another malware types

>many mistaken a worm for a virus

| Feature                   | 🪱 **Worm**                                   | 🦠 **Virus**                             |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Self-Replicates**       | ✅ Yes                                         | ✅ Yes                                    |
| **Needs a Host File**     | ❌ No – it's standalone                        | ✅ Yes – attaches to files or programs    |
| **Spreads Automatically** | ✅ Yes – without user action                   | ❌ No – needs user to run infected file   |
| **Propagation Method**    | Network, email, USB, vulnerabilities          | File sharing, email attachments          |
| **Speed of Spread**       | Very fast (can infect whole networks)         | Slower (requires execution by user)      |
| **Typical Payload**       | May carry other malware (ransomware, spyware) | Often corrupts or modifies host files    |


- **ransomware**: from its name, it is a malware that usually encrypts the system and a ransom is demanded to decrypt the system. usually the ransom is paid unless there is a back up system because the decryption key mostly is complicated and takes many years to be found which coasts the companies time and money more than it will coast them to pay the ransom.

- **Trojan horse**: got its name from the famous story, its a malware that Disguises it self as a normal, harmless software but do bad things behind the scene. its dangerous because its sometimes hard to detect. famous in free (cracked) software's and games.

- **Spyware**: are malware's that is designed to spy on the victim collecting data about them , and here are some of them :
	  - key loggers: record keyboard key strokes reveals passwords, messages, credit card information's.
	  - **Screen Scrapers**: takes screen shots or records the screen.
	  - **System monitors**: tracks users activity(used application's, websites, messages ...)
	>some spywares used to access camera and microphones 

- **Adware**: not so dangerous, Displays unwanted ads and may track user behavior to target advertising

- **Rootkit**: this type of malware hides it self in the system it self, hard to detect and bypasses privileges 

## Phishing and Social Engineering
This type of attacks is not on the system's or network's, it targets **humans**. `Social Engineering Attacks` uses psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information.

**Phishing** it is a type of social engineering attacks that is used in the cyber space by pretending they are a trustworthy source via (email, calls,messages, websites ...)
Phishing types:
1. **Email Phishing**
   The most traditional and common form.
   The attacker sends fake emails pretending to be from a trusted company (e.g., a bank or tech company).
   Often includes:
	   - Urgent messages (e.g., “Your account will be locked!”)
	   - Malicious links or attachments

2. **Spear Phishing**
   this type targets some one in specific, the attacker customizes the message for a specific person or organization using personal information (like name, job role, or recent activity).

3. **Whaling**
   is a type of Spear Phishing that targets higher executives(CEO,CFO ...)

4. **Smishing**
   Phishing via SMS, usually contains malicious link

5. **Vishing**
   phishing via calls , the attacker pretend to be someone from bank or the government ... to trick the victim

6. **Pharming**
   the attacker creates a fake website that looks like a legit one to trick the victim 
   ex. the attacker fakes a bank website that looks like an known bank to trick people to give him/her their credentials 

## Web and Application-Based Attacks
 The attacker targets a website or an application to steal credentials, data or to gain access.
types of Web and Application-Based Attacks:
- **SQL injection** : the attacker injects malicious SQL code in to input field to manipulate the data base or reveal data

- **Cross-Site Scripting(XSS)** : the attacker injects malicious JavaScript to the website , when other people loads the website the malicious JavaScript runs and steal their data (cookies 🍪,session tokens, ...)

- **Command Injection** : the attacker sends system commands through app or website interface that the system executes, can be used to gain access, steal data, manipulates data, damage data ...

- **Remote File Inclusion**: the attacker uploads malicious file in to the website that contains code, **usually** used to gain access

- **Directory Traversal**: the attacker manipulates the URL or input fields to reveal files and data 

## Network-Based Attacks
 These attacks targets the networks and the communication between hosts
- **Denial of Service(DOS)** : the attacker floods the network or server with traffic which makes it unusable for users

- **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** : the same goal as the DOS attack yet instead of sending the malicious traffic from one device its being send from multiple devices which makes it harder to distinguish between it and normal traffic

- **Man-in-the-Middle**: the attacker intercept or alter communication allowing him/her to get the traffic to read it and/or modify it 

- **IP Spoofing** : the attacker uses fake IP address to make data appear like its from trusted source 

- **DNS Spoofing** : the attacker manipulate the DNS server to redirect the users to fake domain's probably malicious ones

- **ARP Spoofing** : the attacker uses his mac address with an IP for another device , usually used as a step in the man in the middle attacks 

- **Packet Sniffing** : the attacker uses sniffers(tools to capture network packets) to read un-encrypted data.

  > The difference between Packet sniffing and man in the middle is the attacker here cant read encrypted data, and the attacker captures all network packets. while in the man in the middle he can red encrypted data most of the time since he intercepted or altered the connection he probably have the encryption key and only listen to active session between tow devices. another thing worth mentioning that man in the middle can be passive or active while packet sniffing is passive only

- **Port Scanning**: the attacker scans the host ports in an attempt to find vulnerable services.

## Insider Threats
 In cyber security human is the weakest node in the chain, humans can be manipulated, tempted, Beside that humans might have other reasons. an insider threat is one of the most dangerous threats, because they already inside the network and have an access to the system, basically they have form of trust and/or access. an angry employee might cause harm to the company, maybe revenge, sometimes its as simple as someone whom might do something without knowledge that destroys something (like deleting the data base for example without knowing).

## Supply Chain Attacks
 here the attacker does not attack the target directly, it attacks a weaker node in the supply chain and use this to attack the target or cause harm , lets say the websites example.com is secure and hosted at a secure server, and it uses the xyz service, the xyz service is weak and exploitable so the attacker exploits it and use it to exploit example.com
