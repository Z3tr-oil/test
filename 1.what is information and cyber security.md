### information security 
is the practice of protecting data from unauthorized access , changing , deletion .Beside taking actions to reduce the overall impact of any incident. you can think of it as power rangers of the internet , but instead of saving peoples life from aliens we save data from the bad guys. data can be electronic (something you save on a digital device) or physical **tangible** (like a computer or a peace of paper) **intangible** (like an idea) to achieve that we need to achieve the **CIA** confidentiality, integrity, availability

**Information security**  offers many specializations, including:
- `Network and infrastructure security` : practices , policies , technologies and procedures used to protect the CIA (confidentiality , integrity , availability) of data and systems within a computer network 
- `Application security` is the practice of making software applications more secure by identifying , fixing and preventing vulnerabilities 
- `Security testing` is the process of evaluating a system , application or a network to find and identify vulnerabilities and weakness or any risk that might be exploited by an attacker  
- `Systems auditing` examining and evaluating and organization IT system's, operations to ensure they are secure 
- `Business continuity` planning creating system's and procedures that essential business functions can continue during and after a disruption (creating backup , implementing protocols)
- `Digital forensics` is the process of identifying, preserving, analyzing and presenting digital evidences in a way that is legally admissible. It is often used in investigations involving cyber crime, fraud, data breaches, and unauthorized access to systems.(after the incident happens)
- `Incident detection and response` is the process of identifying and responding to cyber security threats and breaches to minimize damage, recover quickly, and prevent future incidents.(while the incident is happening)
### information security VS cyber security 
while cyber security and information security might seem similar at first sight they are different terms.
**information security** means protecting information's and information systems,prevent the unauthorized access or use of information, including its disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction. 
**cyber security** means preventing damage and restoring computers and electronic communications systems, including the digital information stored in these systems and devices.
still not quite clear right. well the min difference is not in the definition its on what we are really protecting, cyber security focus on protecting the digital data, but remember not all data is saved in a digital way, information security focuses on protecting all kind of data (digital , tangible, intangible). which means cyber security is part of the information security umbrella.

### security

we were talking about information security and cyber security , but what is security and how we can define it, `security` is a state of freedom from a danger, threat or harm, it involves measures to protect people, property from various forms of risk or attack.
to achieve that in the information's term (information security) we need to insure that the data is not damaged, manipulated, and accessed any time to the people that needs it. the `CIA` standard was created to make sure that the data is protected and secured.

### Red team VS Blue team
you might heard before about red team and blue team, but what are they. Red team are good guys pretending to be bad guys. Blue team are the good guys that are **defending** the system from the real bad guys.
Red teamers try to find the exploits and attacks before the real bad guys do, that way we can secure the system safely, they try to break to the system to find, identify any possible weakness that might lead to breaking the system security. most common tasks are penetration testing , social engineering and other offensive techniques.
Blu teamers are the majority. their job is to harden the system security by analyzing the risks, coming up with policies, responding to threats

### Risk management 
is the process of identification, evaluation, and prioritization of risks, the goal is to minimize and/or control the impact of the probability of the impact to happen. Infosec is part of the risk management process to achieve data protection.
